# MatchFutBot with JDA

## Resume

A Discord bot for my ongoing MatchFut project, which aims to provide information about the date, time, and platform/channel where football matches will be broadcasted.

## Technologies

Currently using Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 and Java Discord API (JDA) 5.
In addition, I'm using dotenv-java 3 for storing the Discord Bot TOKEN
